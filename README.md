This is a fullstack application that allows users to view and manage clinical trials and patient response data that I built to learn more about the GraphQL and Next.js tech stack.

# üß™ Clinical Trial Dashboard  
*A Fullstack Project using Next.js, GraphQL, and Azure PostgreSQL*

## Overview

This project is a simple clinical trial dashboard built to explore fullstack development using:
- **Next.js (with TypeScript)** for frontend and routing
- **GraphQL Yoga** for API server implementation
- **Azure PostgreSQL** for cloud-hosted relational data

It allows users to:
- üîç Search and filter clinical trials by name and phase  
- üìÑ View patient response data grouped by trial  
- ‚ûï Add new patient records via a form using GraphQL mutations

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (TypeScript), React
- **Backend**: GraphQL Yoga served via Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Azure PostgreSQL
- **GraphQL Client**: `graphql-request`
- **Hosting**: Designed for deployment on platforms like Netlify or Vercel
